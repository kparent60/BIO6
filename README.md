# BIO6
Intelligent MyoElectric Prosthesis (IMP)

## Material needed
The material needed for the project is:

1. MyoWare Muscle Sensor
2. 3m Red Dot Monitoring Electrode (or any other EMG/ECG can do the job)
3. Arduino Uno/Mega 2560
4. 5 Servo Motors SG90
5. 3D printer (or you can have a company that does the pieces for you)
6. Infrared camera
7. Some strings

## How it works
A MyoWare is a component that can modulate electrical discharges from any muscle of the corpse. It uses 3 electrodes that are placed differently on the muscle. 
Those electrodes are threated by the MyoWare as a differential and can show you the applied force of your targetted muscle. 

You must use the Arduino code given to be able to use the 5 motors that will be modified depending on the force you're applying.
Before using you're Arduino, you must be sure that your electrodes are well placed on your clean targetted muscle (the datasheet of the MyoWare explains where to place the electrodes).

The code can be changed with some notes on it and we're very welcoming on updates or corrections to our code. Thank you!
